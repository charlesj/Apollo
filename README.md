# Apollo

This is my personal artificial brain and chat bot.

Locally, the server is meant to run in the vagrant box, but the client can run
from either the vm or locally.  The performance of the compiler is much better
locally and is run more often, so this is my preference.


## Tech
- Server: .NET/C# on Mono
- Client: Emberjs with EmberCLI
- Database: Postgres with migrations by Alembic / Sql Alchemy
- Infrastructure: Ansible - `i <3 plabooks`
